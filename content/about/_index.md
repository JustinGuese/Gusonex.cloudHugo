Since I have been a child, I have been passionate about new technologies. I started building my first robot with 12, offered translations and Webdesign around the ages of 16, and soon had one of the experiences of my life exploring Australia for one year during a work and travel stay.

Soon after I started my first blog about Work and Travel in Australia, learning all about SEO, Webdesign and Amazon Affiliate links. But my main focus has been on my studies of cognitive science, wonderfully uniting all the knowledge around the brain – be it Neurobiology, Neuroinformatics or Philosophy of Mind, and many more.

Soon the next opportunity to discover the world lay in front of me: an ERASMUS year at the great TU Graz in Austria, in which I had the opportunity to deepen my knowledge in Computational Neuroscience and Rehabilitation Engineering. Because my Bachelor studies were almost done, I already started the Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering, with a focus on Computational neuroscience and learned a lot about neuronal networks and machine learning.
During this ERASMUS year, I partook in a project called "Product Innovation Project", in which university students cooperate with a company to build a working prototype that solves a problem of them in a time span of one year.

Our efforts resulted in a fully working 360-degree scanner for used cars, offering customers a way to build way more trust during the used car customer journey. Our results were presented by myself and two colleagues in front of an audience of 500+ people and received great support.
Soon after that company, called Porsche Austria, offered me a job as Data Scientist/Cloud Solution Architect, in which I had the chance to fulfill many great projects (see Projects section), meet amazing people and educate myself at several conferences, courses, and certifications.

And now? I am currently in an educational leave offered by the Austrian state in which I finalize my studies, learn all there is about Cloud, ML, VR and Big Data that is possible and try to help other businesses and people to achieve great things using new technologies.

What do you think about these new technologies? Are you currently dealing with a challenge? Want to know more?
