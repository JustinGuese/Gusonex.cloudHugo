# BIG DATA: What it is and why you should care.

Big data describes large volumes of data, further divided into structured and unstructured data (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data" target="_blank" >Source</a>). Of course this is a vague definition, but in general, one can speak of Big Data if classic tools are not adequate anymore, and for processing the vast amounts of data special tools are needed.

> "By 2025, IDC predicts there will be 163 zettabytes of data." (<a href="https://www.seagate.com/files/www-content/our-story/trends/files/idc-seagate-dataage-whitepaper.pdf" target="blank">Source</a>)

### Enormous amounts of data

The amount of data generated will exponentially rise in the next years, is predicted to even reach 163 zettabytes of data generated according to the IDC.
This will force companies to deal with rising storage demands, replacement of existing analytic tools, and probably a change of their personal, which can easily overwhelm them if data is not their core focus.

### Is Big Data evil?

Every new technology seems to scare people at first, but people easily forget about the huge benefits offered by it. For example, with more precise recommendations processes can be massively improved, or the revenue of a company easily increased.

### What are the benefits of Big Data?

#### 1. Cost Savings

Using the right tools like Hadoop or Public Cloud providers can help enormously reduce traditional costs compared to On-Premise database hosting. There are several "tricks" of Big Data to compress files, reduce the required processing power and much more.

#### 2. Time reduction

Distributed tools like Hadoop or Elasticsearch can greatly reduce the time of processing. E.g. some tools try to precalculate queries to instantly deliver an answer if it is requested, or distribute the tasks to several machines automatically. This saves a lot of time compared to a single machine performing the same task.

#### 3. Improve Customer experiences
Every person is different, therefore it is difficult to find one specific customer journey that satisfies all customers. On the contrary, if your company defines too many different customer journeys, you would need a lot of staff. Big Data helps, in this case, to examine the optimal process for each of your customers and deliver the right strategy automatically.

#### 4. Error prevention
Once a stable algorithm or toolkit is defined, errors will be greatly reduced. If a human is processing information, especially repetitive ones, errors can easily happen. A stable algorithm and pipeline can greatly reduce the amounts of error occuring.

#### 5. Data Driven Company
There are almost impossible applications of Big Data waiting to be unveiled. Utilizing all the data a company generates, turnover might even triple and budget consuming processes can be defined and eliminated. Do you want to find out how?
