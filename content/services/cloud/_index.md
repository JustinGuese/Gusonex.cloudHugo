## Cloud - What it is and why you should act today.

Cloud Computing is rising rapidly, predicted to grow more than six times the rate of general IT in 2020 [Source] (https://www.salesforce.com/uk/blog/2017/10/idc-how-the-salesforce-economy-is-driving-growth-and-creating-jo.html), which is mainly due to the enormous benefits it is offering. But many businesses struggle with the adaption, mainly because it is such a new technology that should not be implemented without any thought. Way too often a too hastily implementation resulted in huge data lakes, that did not even spare the biggest companies:

#### 1. Microsoft
In late 2010 Microsoft discovered a breach which resulted in a huge leak of their employee contact info, which was due to an authentification error in the code [Source](https://www.pcworld.com/article/214775/microsoft_cloud_data_breach_sign_of_future.html).

#### 2. Dropbox
In 2012 hackers stole 68 million user accounts and posted them on a dark web marketplace, allowing buyers to get all the data for a mere sum of 1,141 USD [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37232635). This is what can happen if the security of a database is not good enough.

#### 3. Apple iCloud
Maybe the most-known data leak in the cloud happened, when in 2014 hackers gained access to private pictures stored in iCloud, Apple's cloud service. A security issue in the iCloud API resulted in around 500 private pictures of celebrities being sold online [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICloud_leaks_of_celebrity_photos).

## The Top 4 benefits of Cloud

But if Cloud technology is implemented in a good and secure way, many benefits arise:

#### 1. Cost Reduction

Due to the possibility of just buy the resources that you use instead of buying whole server architectures, you are never paying for servers that are not in use. Let us look at an example: If a data analyst is using a huge Hadoop Cluster during working hours, but they are idling at night, a lot of efficiencies is wasted. What if instead the analyst can dynamically allocate resources in the cloud and just use them if they are needed?

#### 2. Scalability

The same principle goes for scalability. Let us take Black Friday as an example. On this day websites experience a huge demand for customers arriving at their websites. To fully handle this load, a huge server architecture is needed. But if these servers are mostly idling on all the other days, a company will experience high server costs even though they are not used. Scaling means, that you dynamically allocate resources in the cloud to meet your changing computational demands.

#### 3. Flexibility and Innovation

In traditional architectures, provisioning servers can take months. With the Public Cloud, servers can easily be provisioned in seconds and shut-down in about the same time. This allows for easy deployment of experiments and innovation without high risks.

#### 4. Serverless

One of the biggest benefits is the rising offer of serverless architectures. With serverless developers can focus on their code, and do not need to worry about server updates, security patches and hardware failures. Head over to [Serverless](/services/serverless) to find out more.

Now the remaining question is: How could you benefit from the cloud? This is a huge topic, and can not be answered in a single sentence. But feel free to give me a call, or comment below and let us discuss possible applications in your environment.
