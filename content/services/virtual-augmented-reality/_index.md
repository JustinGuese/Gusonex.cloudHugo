So what is causing this huge prediction of AR and VR?
Currently, we are used to two-dimensional screens to gather information, but with augmented or virtual reality we are adding a new dimension which allows for way more input to be received. Furthermore,  we are living in a three-dimensional world, so naturally, we are way more used to interact in a virtual three-dimensional world and even people that are not used to interact with computers can usually easily handle these environments.

But what makes Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality so interesting?

### Everyone can use it
Especially with Augmented Reality, almost all current smartphones support it. This means, that users do not need anything more than a phone (which everyone has) and an internet connection to view content. Virtual reality glasses are currently still only affordable for dedicated users, but with the time prices will go down and these glasses might be at home like current televisions.

### Endless possibilities
The nice thing about virtual and augmented reality is, that we are not bound to constraints of reality. Take a movie for example: For once, it is hard to cram all the content into a specified time, the screen size itself, and film stunts requiring really dangerous settings. With a virtual environment, everything is possible. Do you want to make users fly with their own arms? Possible. Bend the laws of physics and let users levitate? All is possible with these exciting possibilities.

### Enormous interactivity

Several studies show, that both technologies are way more "immersive and engaging through the mechanism of spatial presence" (Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6389766/), and therefore engaging than traditional learning and advertisement methods. As anyone can relate, this is true, because if you are doing things instead of just watching how to do it, it becomes way easier to understand.

### A new start for advertisements

> "65 percent of users find ads annoying"

According to a recent study  (Source https://bit.ly/2Ogj4KM), 65 percent of users find advertisements annoying, mainly because they are interrupting what users are doing. Now with AR and VR, users can choose when to play the content and are way more likely to start an interaction with the content - and therefore offer ads a new start and possibly a change from a necessity, to something users may enjoy.
