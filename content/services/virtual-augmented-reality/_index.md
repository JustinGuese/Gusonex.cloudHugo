So what is causing this huge prediction of AR and VR?
Currently, we are used to two-dimensional screens to gather information, but with augmented or virtual reality we are adding a new dimension which allows for way more input to be received. Furthermore,  we are living in a three-dimensional world, so naturally, we are way more used to interact in a virtual three-dimensional world and even people that are not used to interact with computers can usually easily handle these environments.
