A digital twin in marketing is a user that is similar to a user that has already been on your website.
This is done because you are already knowing what products or pages the user viewed and can offer a similar using the same experience.
But how is this done?

## Big Data aspects of a digital twin

First, we saved all the web events of our websites in a No-SQL database called Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch is a great application for text-based search and quick queries on huge databases using Lucene.

### Graph search in Elasticsearch

Simplified, we used a graph search that is integrated into Elasticsearch (see https://www.elastic.co/de/what-is/elasticsearch-graph) to find users that are similar to the current user. Via REST-API calls with the matching Lucene queries, similar products from digital twins were extracted, and presented as recommendations to the current user.

### Challenges using Elasticsearch for Digital Twins

A huge challenge in this scenario has been speed. Users usually leave a website if it loads longer than 250ms. This expands drastically, with 11% of the users leaving after one second loading time, and around 90% with more than four seconds of loading time (Source: https://think.storage.googleapis.com/docs/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks.pdf). Therefore we had to optimize the Elasticsearch cluster and partly simplify our queries to achieve a loading time of around 200ms. How? Leave a message below or contact me to find out more.
